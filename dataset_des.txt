<p><span><span><span>Contestants are asked to create a statistical model to predict tropical cyclone (TC) intensity change in 24 hours using advanced machine learning techniques. There are 2 sets of TC data from 1998 to 2010; one is the predictors operationally used in a statistical TC intensity forecast model (SHIPS1998-2010.nc). The other is satellite observations with spatially and temporally varying features of TC structures (Prcpxxxx.nc). Combined use of two datasets are expected to yield better results than using one dataset only. All the data are in NetCDF format.</span></span></span></p>_x000D_

This dataset is typically updated monthly on a two-month lag, as bases have until the conclusion of the following month to submit a month of trip records to the TLC. In example, a base has until Feb 28 to submit complete trip records for January. Therefore, the January base aggregates will appear in March at the earliest. The TLC may elect to defer updates to the FHV Base Aggregate Report if a large number of bases have failed to submit trip records by the due date._x000D_

Note: The TLC publishes base trip record data as submitted by the bases, and we cannot guarantee or confirm their accuracy or completeness. Therefore, this may not represent the total amount of trips dispatched by all TLC-licensed bases. The TLC performs routine reviews of the records and takes enforcement actions when necessary to ensure, to the extent possible, complete and accurate information."

_x000D_
Cases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths are those occurring among cases based on the day of death. Hospitalizations are based on the date of first hospitalization. Only one hospitalization is counted for each case. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers or collected by CDPH during follow-up investigation._x000D_

Cases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the ���Cases - Weekly��� column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death._x000D_
 _x000D_
For tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection._x000D_

15,Traffic Crashes - Crashes,"Crash data shows information about each traffic crash on city streets within the City of Chicago limits and under the jurisdiction of Chicago Police Department (CPD). Data are shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information. Records are added to the data portal when a crash report is finalized or when amendments are made to an existing report in E-Crash. Data from E-Crash are available for some police districts in 2015, but citywide data are not available until September 2017. About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset._x000D_
_x000D_
All crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form. The current version of the SR1050 instructions manual with detailed information on each data elements is available <a href=""https://idot.illinois.gov/Assets/uploads/files/Transportation-System/Manuals-Guides-&-Handbooks/Safety/Illinois Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual 2019.pdf"">here</a>._x000D_
_x000D_
As per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here."
16,Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes,"The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For the most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to the <a href=""https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-collision.page"" style=""color:#187bcd;"">NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page</a> (updated weekly) or <a href=""http://www.nycvzv.info/"" style=""color:#187bcd;"">Vision Zero View</a> (updated monthly)._x000D_
_x000D_
</p>_x000D_
Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department���s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable."
17,Building Permits,"INFORMATION ABOUT 7/12/2019 CHANGES TO THIS DATASET: http://bit.ly/2XV3ERS -- This dataset includes information about currently-valid building permits issued by the City of Chicago from 2006 to the present.

23,Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings,"This dataset contains individual-level homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, including homicide data from 1991 to the present, and non-fatal shooting data from 2010 to the present (2010 is the earliest available year for shooting data). This dataset includes a ""GUNSHOT_INJURY_I "" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (""Y""), No (""N""), or Unknown (""UKNOWN."") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the ""shooting"" column will read either ""Y"" or ""N"" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as ���Y.��� Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized-access dataset, but with ""UNKNOWN"" in the shooting column.

Each row represents a single victimization, i.e., a unique event when an individual became the victim of a homicide or non-fatal shooting. Each row does not represent a unique victim���if someone is victimized multiple times there will be multiple rows for each of those distinct events. 

The dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow the Chicago Police Department (CPD) time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.

A version of this dataset with additional crime types is available by request. To make a request, please email <a href=""mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org?subject=Violence Reduction Victims Access Request"">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> with the subject line: <b>Violence Reduction Victims Access Request</b>. Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup.

How does this dataset classify victims?

The methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:

Homicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.

To determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. 
For a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset do not align with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization:

1. In instances where a homicide victimization does not correspond to an IUCR code 0110 or 0130, we set the IUCR code to ""01XX""  to indicate that the victimization was a homicide but we do not know whether it was a first-degree murder"

25,Food Inspections,"This information is derived from inspections of restaurants and other food establishments in Chicago from January 1, 2010 to the present. Inspections are performed by staff from the Chicago Department of Public Health���s Food Protection Program using a standardized procedure. The results of the inspection are inputted into a database, then reviewed and approved by a State of Illinois Licensed Environmental Health Practitioner (LEHP).

_x000D_
The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago���s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials._x000D_
_x000D_
Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O���Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes._x000D_
_x000D_
The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions."
34,COVID-19 Vaccine Doses by ZIP Code - Series Completed,"COVID-19 vaccinations administered to Chicago residents based on the home Zip Code of the person vaccinated, as provided by the medical provider in Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). The Zip Code where a person lives is not necessarily the same Zip Code where the vaccine was administered. Daily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, first doses only, and number of people who have completed the necessary doses to be considered fully vaccinated. Cumulative totals for each measure as of that date are also provided. Requirements to be considered fully vaccinated vary depending on the vaccine manufacturer. Initial vaccines require two doses of vaccine to be administered over a period of time specific to each vaccine brand; future vaccines may only require one dose to be considered fully vaccinated. Vaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered. _x000D_

When an inspection results in more than one violation, values for associated fields are repeated for each additional violation record.  Establishments are uniquely identified by their CAMIS (record ID) number. Keep in mind that thousands of restaurants start business and go out of business every year; only restaurants in an active status are included in the dataset. _x000D_
Records are also included for each restaurant that has applied for a permit but has not yet been inspected and for inspections resulting in no violations. Establishments with inspection date of 1/1/1900 are new establishments that have not yet received an inspection. Restaurants that received no violations are represented by a single row and coded as having no violations using the ACTION field. _x000D_

48,Housing Maintenance Code Violations,"Pursuant to New York City���s Housing Maintenance Code, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) issues violations against conditions, in rental dwelling units and buildings, that have been verified to violate the New York City Housing Maintenance Code (HMC) or the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law (MDL)._x000D_
Each row in this dataset contains discrete information about one violation of the New York City Housing Maintenance Code or New York State Multiple Dwelling Law. Each violation is identified using a unique Violation ID. These Laws are in place to provide requirements for the maintenance of residential dwelling units within New York City. _x000D_
Violations are issued by Housing Inspectors after a physical inspection is conducted (except for class I violations which are generally  administratively issued).  Violations are issued in four classes: Class A (non-hazardous), Class B (hazardous), Class C (immediately hazardous) and Class I (information orders).  For more information on violations, see https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/compliance-clear-violations.page  _x000D_
The base data for this file is all violations open as of October 1, 2012.  Violation data is updated daily.  The daily update includes both new violations and updates to the status of previously issued violations. An open violation is a violation which is still active on the Department records. See the status table for determining how to filter for open violations versus closed violations, and within open violations for a more detailed current status. _x000D_
The property owner may or may not have corrected the physical condition if the status is open. The violation status is closed when the violation is observed/verified as corrected by HPD or as certified by the landlord.   The processes for having violations dismissed are described at http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/compliance-clear-violations.page_x000D_

Access will require an account on this site, which you may create at https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup. New data fields may be added to this public dataset in the future._x000D_
_x000D_
The data is limited to adult arrests, defined as any arrest where the arrestee was 18 years of age or older on the date of arrest. The data excludes arrest records expunged by CPD pursuant to the Illinois Criminal Identification Act (20 ILCS 2630/5.2). _x000D_
_x000D_
Department members use charges that appear in Illinois Compiled Statutes or Municipal Code of Chicago. Arrestees may be charged with multiple offenses from these sources. Each record in the dataset includes up to four charges, ordered by severity and with CHARGE1 as the most severe charge. Severity is defined based on charge class and charge type, criteria that are routinely used by Illinois court systems to determine penalties for conviction. In case of a tie, charges are presented in the order that the arresting officer listed the charges on the arrest report. By policy, Department members are provided general instructions to emphasize seriousness of the offense when ordering charges on an arrest report. _x000D_
_x000D_
Each record has an additional set of columns where a charge characteristic (statute, description, type, or class) for all four charges, or fewer if there were not four charges, is concatenated with the | character. These columns can be used with the Filter function's ""Contains"" operator to find all records where a value appears, without having to search four separate columns._x000D_

For more info, see: https://www.nycedc.com/program/graffiti-free-nyc. The COVID-19 is having a significant impact on the City���s economy and finances. As of April 21, 2020, to ensure the City can continue to devote resources to essential safety, health, shelter, and food security needs, the City suspended the Graffiti Free NYC program indefinitely. As a result, 311 has suspended processing of graffiti removal service requests."
55,COVID-19 Hospital Capacity,"<i><b>Note: As of July 21, 2021, this dataset no longer updates.</i></b>

<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
Data on daily hospital bed use and available capacity at San Francisco acute care hospitals from April 2020 onward. Long Term Care facilities (like Laguna Honda and Kentfield) are not included in this data as acute care patients cannot be admitted to these facilities.
<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
This hospital capacity information is based on data that all SF acute care hospitals report to the San Francisco Department of Public Health.
<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. This data is on a 4-day lag to account for the time needed to complete and validate data from all SF acute care hospitals. 
<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
This data provides visibility into current occupancy levels and use of San Francisco acute care hospitals and potential ability to accommodate anticipated surges of COVID patients. 
Data includes current census of COVID-19 patients (including both confirmed cases and suspected COVID patients) and other patients in acute care hospitals, shown in the ���Status��� column. The ���Status��� column also includes all available beds.
This daily census information is stratified by type of bed (acute care, intensive care, and surge) in the ���Bed Type��� column. Acute care beds treat patients with illnesses and injuries including recovery from surgeries. Intensive care (ICU) beds are for sicker patients in need of critical and life support services that can include the use of a ventilator. Surge beds are the additional beds that can be made available to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients; surge beds are differentiated between acute care surge beds and ICU surge beds.
Note: The current census of COVID patients shown here may not always match the hospitalizations data (https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Hospitalizations/nxjg-bhem), as that data includes all hospitals and long term care facilities. As described above, those long term care facilities are not included here as they don���t have the capacity to take in additional acute care patients and therefore aren���t included in capacity measures."

Index offenses are the offenses that are collected nation-wide by the Federal Bureaus of Investigation���s Uniform Crime Reports program to document crime trends over time (data released semi-annually), and include murder, criminal sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault & battery, burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.

83,COVID-19 Cases by Geography and Date,"<i><b>Note: As of April 16, 2021, this dataset will update daily with a five-day data lag.</i></b>

<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
This dataset contains COVID-19 positive confirmed cases aggregated by several different geographic areas and by day. COVID-19 cases are mapped to the residence of the individual and shown on the date the positive test was collected. In addition, 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year population estimates are included to calculate the cumulative rate per 10,000 residents.

Dataset covers cases going back to March 2nd, 2020 when testing began. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases and data will change to reflect as information becomes available. Data updated daily.

Geographic areas summarized are:
1. <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h"">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>
2. <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Census-2010-Tracts-for-San-Francisco/rarb-5ahf"">Census Tracts</a>
3. <a href=""https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html"">Census Zip Code Tabulation Areas</a>

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
Addresses from the COVID-19 case data are geocoded by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Those addresses are spatially joined to the geographic areas. Counts are generated based on the number of address points that match each geographic area for a given date.

The 2019 ACS estimates for population provided by the Census are used to create a cumulative rate which is equal to ([cumulative count up to that date] / [acs_population]) * 10000) representing the number of total cases per 10,000 residents (as of the specified date).

COVID-19 case data undergo quality assurance and other data verification processes and are continually updated to maximize completeness and accuracy of information. This means data may change for previous days as information is updated.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Geographic analysis is scripted by SFDPH staff and synced to this dataset daily at 05:00 Pacific Time.

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
This dataset can be used to track the spread of COVID-19 throughout the city, in a variety of geographic areas. Note that the new cases column in the data represents the number of new cases confirmed in a certain area on the specified day, while the cumulative cases column is the cumulative total of cases in a certain area as of the specified date.

<em>Privacy rules in effect</em>
To protect privacy, certain rules are in effect:
1. Any area with a cumulative case count less than 10 are dropped for all days the cumulative count was less than 10. These will be null values.
2. Once an area has a cumulative case count of 10 or greater, that area will have a new row of case data every day following.
3. Cases are dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000
4. Deaths data are not included in this dataset for privacy reasons. The low COVID-19 death rate in San Francisco, along with other publicly available information on deaths, means that deaths data by geography and day is too granular and potentially risky. Read more in our <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Data-Tracker-Publishing-Privacy-Guideline/9aj4-um47"">privacy guidelines</a>

<em>Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20</em>
Rates are not calculated unless the cumulative case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology.

<em>A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)</em>
ZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website."
84,Fire Department Calls for Service,"Fire Calls-For-Service includes all fire units responses to calls.

93,Traffic Crashes - Vehicles,"This dataset contains information about vehicles (or units as they are identified in crash reports) involved in a traffic crash. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the traffic Crash and People dataset available in the portal. ���Vehicle��� information includes motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle modes of transportation, such as bicycles and pedestrians. Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a ���unit��� and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units. However, people inside a vehicle including the driver do not have a trajectory separate from the vehicle in which they are travelling and hence only the vehicle they are travelling in get any entry here. This type of identification of ���units��� is needed to determine how each movement affected the crash. Data for occupants who do not make up an independent unit, typically drivers and passengers, are available in the People table. Many of the fields are coded to denote the type and location of damage on the vehicle. Vehicle information can be linked back to Crash data using the ���CRASH_RECORD_ID��� field. Since this dataset is a combination of vehicles, pedestrians, and pedal cyclists not all columns are applicable to each record. Look at the Unit Type field to determine what additional data may be available for that record._x000D_

For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19._x000D_
_x000D_
This dataset is a companion to the COVID-19 Daily Cases and Deaths dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/naz8-j4nc). The major difference in this dataset is that the case, death, and hospitalization corresponding rates per 100,000 population are not those for the single date indicated. They are rolling averages for the seven-day period ending on that date. This rolling average is used to account for fluctuations that may occur in the data, such as fewer cases being reported on weekends, and small numbers.  The intent is to give a more representative view of the ongoing COVID-19 experience, less affected by what is essentially noise in the data._x000D_
_x000D_
All rates are per 100,000 population in the indicated group, or Chicago, as a whole, for ���Total��� columns._x000D_
_x000D_
Only Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider._x000D_
_x000D_
Cases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths among cases are aggregated by day of death. Hospitalizations are reported by date of first hospital admission. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers or collected by CDPH during follow-up investigation._x000D_
_x000D_
Denominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2018 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2018 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa)._x000D_

Some location fields with missing data are noted as (0��, 0��). Address fields are only provided to the nearest hundred block in order to maintain privacy. This data is as accurate as the data in the database. Please note questions or concerns in the comments."
175,Building Footprints,"These footprint extents are collapsed from an earlier 3D building model provided by Pictometry of 2010, and have been refined from a version of building masses publicly available on the open data portal for over two years.The building masses were manually split with reference to parcel lines, but using vertices from the building mass wherever possible.These split footprints correspond closely to individual structures even where there are common walls; the goal of the splitting process was to divide the building mass wherever there was likely to be a firewall.
An arbitrary identifier was assigned based on a descending sort of building area for 177,023 footprints. The centroid of each footprint was used to join a property identifier from a draft of the San Francisco Enterprise GIS Program's cartographic base, which provides continuous coverage with distinct right-of-way areas as well as selected nearby parcels from adjacent counties. See accompanying document SF_BldgFoot_2017-05_description.pdf for more on methodology and motivation"

List of ordinance violations filed with the Department of Administrative Hearings. This data set reflects violations brought before the Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings.  It does not reflect violations brought before the Circuit Court of Cook County. Each row of data represents a unique violation. Multiple violations may be associated with a single case. The most recent status of the case is shown in the dataset and is updated daily. Hearing date corresponds to the date of the most recent hearing. Each case often consists of multiple hearings and may encounter continuances due to various circumstances before a final disposition is rendered. The case disposition, date of the disposition, and any applicable fines and administrative costs are listed when the case is fully completed. The latest hearing status or disposition reflects the condition of the property at that time and may not reflect the current condition of the property. When multiple respondents are cited, each respondent is separated by a pipe (""|"") character. Respondents sometimes are added to cases for technical legal reasons so are not necessarily the parties believed to have committed the violations. This dataset currently lists violations issued by the Department of Buildings. Additional ordinance violations will be added over time.  Therefore, it is advisable to use the department-specific filtered view listed under the More Views button for purposes that require only one department's violations."
178,2011 NYC School Survey,"Every year, all parents, all teachers, and students in grades 6 - 12 take the NYC School Survey. The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. _x000D_

Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependant on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. _x000D_
_x000D_
The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. _x000D_

201,Building and Safety Permit Information Old,"The Department of Building and Safety issues permits for the construction, remodeling, and repair of buildings and structures in the City of Los Angeles.  Permits are categorized into building permits, electrical permits, and mechanical permits (which include plumbing, HVAC systems, fire sprinklers, elevators, and pressure vessels).  Depending on the complexity of a project, a permit may be issued the same day with Express Permit or e-Permit (""No Plan Check"" category), or a permit may require that the plans be reviewed (""Plan Check"" category) by a Building and Safety Plan Check personnel."
202,Violence Reduction - Shotspotter Alerts,"This dataset contains all ShotSpotter alerts since the introduction of ShotSpotter to some Chicago Police Department (CPD) districts in 2017. ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system designed to automatically determine the location of potential outdoor gunfire. ShotSpotter audio sensors are placed in several CPD districts throughout the city (specific districts are noted below). If at least three sensors detect a sound that the ShotSpotter software determines to be potential gunfire, a location is determined and the alert is sent to human ShotSpotter analysts for review. Either the alert is sent to CPD, or it is dismissed. Each alert can contain multiple rounds of gunfire; sometimes there are multiple alerts for what may be determined to be one incident. More detail on the technology and its accuracy can be found on the company���s website <a href=""https://www.shotspotter.com"">here</a>. It should also be noted that ShotSpotter alerts may increase year-over-year while gun violence did not necessarily increase accordingly because of improvements in detection sensors._x000D_

ShotSpotter does not exist in every CPD district, and it was not rolled out in every district at the same time. ShotSpotter was first deployed in Chicago in 2017, and sensors exist in the following districts as of the May 2021 launch of this dataset: 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011, 015, and 025."

225,Chicago COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI),"The Chicago CCVI identifies communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and are vulnerable to barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake���. Vulnerability is defined as a combination of sociodemographic factors, epidemiological factors���, occupational factors���, and cumulative COVID-19 burden. 

The 10 components of the index include COVID-19 specific risk factors and outcomes and social factors known to be associated with social vulnerability in the context of emergency preparedness. The CCVI is derived from ranking values of the components by Chicago Community Area, then synthesizing them into a single composite weighted score.  The higher the score, the more vulnerable the geographic area.

ZIP Code CCVI is included to enable comparison with other COVID-19 data available on the Chicago Data Portal. Some elements of the CCVI are not available by ZIP Code. To create ZIP Code CCVI, the proportion of the ZIP Code population contributed by each Community Areas was determined. The apportioned populations were then weighted by the Community Area CCVI score and averaged to determine a ZIP Code CCVI score. 

The COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is adapted and modified from a Surgo Ventures collaboration (https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi) and the CDC Social Vulnerability Index���. ZIP Codes are based on ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

230,Motor Vehicle Collisions - Person,"The Motor Vehicle Collisions person table contains details for people involved in the crash. Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system._x000D_
</p>_x000D_
The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details._x000D_
</p>_x000D_
Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department���s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable."

Population counts are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2015-2019 5-year estimates and can be seen in the ZIP Code, 2019 rows of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa).

Actual counts may exceed population estimates and lead to >100% coverage, especially in areas with small population sizes. Additionally, the medical provider may report a work address or incorrect home address for the person receiving the vaccination which may lead to over or under estimates of vaccination coverage by geography.���

All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH.

Numbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to when data are reported and how City of Chicago boundaries are defined.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)  The collection of street segments for a single zone (collectively identified by Zone number) are not required to constitute a seamless polygon; however, they must be contiguous; in this sense, ���Zones��� often closer resemble a collection of intersecting segments rather than an unbroken area. Segments are commonly categorized as being either ���Standard��� or ���Buffer���: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as ���Buffer��� can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., ���All Times��� / ���Anytime���; ���Monday through Friday���; ���6am ��� 6pm All Days.���  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.

As of 2016, this list includes all commercial, institutional, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet. The information in this dataset should be used by building owners / managers or other building representatives to determine if your property needs to comply by the annual deadline of June 1st. This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance. (The ID is also included the notification letters sent by the City.)_x000D_
_x000D_
The Energy Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago���s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking._x000D_
_x000D_
Note that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c._x000D_

The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system._x000D_
</p>_x000D_
The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details._x000D_
</p>_x000D_
Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department���s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable."
259,Roadway Construction Moratoriums,"Moratoriums are established by the Department of Transportation as a method of protecting reconstructed or repaved roadways within the boundaries of the city.

By having access to this Moratorium list in advance, contractors or utilities with projects that require excavation of roadways can more effectively plan and review conflicts that will be encountered. Currently, roadway sections with active moratoriums have special consideration as to method and size of restoration, and additionally, increased permit fees. Three moratorium types are displayed on this web site: (1) Street Construction is used when the street has been reconstructed. By City ordinance, the moratorium is ten (10) years and during this period permit fees are doubled. (2) Street Resurfacing is used when the road has been repaved. By City ordinance, the moratorium is seven (7) years and during this period permit fees are doubled. (3) Median or Median Landscaping is used where landscaped medians or planters exist on the street median. For these moratoriums types, there is no fee adjustment; however, if a construction permit is being requested, the applicant will be directed to review the planned project with the Department of Transportation/Division of Engineering staff for special instructions on how to properly protect or reconstruct street medians."

DOB NOW: BUILD is an online portal that allows users to file for permit applications, check the status of an application, make payments, schedule appointments, and print permits. 

Data in this collection is limited to elevator applications (also known as ELV1) submitted through DOB NOW, and includes Initial (New), Subsequent, and Post Approval Amendment (PAA) filing types. The collection includes all electrical applications submitted to the Department of Buildings since December 11, 2017, when the applications were launched in DOB NOW and were no longer accepted through other submission processes.

This dataset contains details for each device on the application. There should be one row per device/Job Filing Number in this dataset. For example, an Initial Permit Application for Device 1234 and Device 5678 would have 2 rows (one for 1234 and one for 5678). If a Post Approval Amendment (PAA) was submitted for this application, then the Device rows would be repeated but the Job Filing Number would have a P1 suffix to indicate the PAA."

The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite���s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1). The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet."

The information displayed represents a de-identified listing of arrest data from August 1, 2012 to July 31, 2016, that was used by the Chicago Police Department���s Strategic Subject Algorithm, created by the Illinois Institute of Technology and funded through a Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance grant, to create a risk assessment score known as the Strategic Subject List or ���SSL.��� These scores reflect an individual���s probability of being involved in a shooting incident either as a victim or an offender. Scores are calculated and placed on a scale ranging from 0 (extremely low risk) to 500 (extremely high risk). 

Based on this time frame���s version of the Strategic Subject Algorithm, individuals with criminal records are ranked using eight attributes, not including race or sex. These attributes are: number of times being the victim of a shooting incident, age during the latest arrest, number of times being the victim of aggravated battery or assault, number of prior arrests for violent offenses, gang affiliation, number of prior narcotic arrests, trend in recent criminal activity and number of prior unlawful use of weapon arrests. 

Please note that this data set includes fields that are not used to calculate SSL, for example, neither race nor sex are used in the Strategic Subject Algorithm. Portions of the arrest data are de-identified on the basis of privacy concerns. The attributes used in the Strategic Subject Algorithm were revised on an ongoing basis during the lifetime of the program."

The data reflects violations that occurred from July 1, 2014 until present, minus the most recent 14 days. This data may change due to occasional time lags between the capturing of a potential violation and the processing and determination of a violation. The most recent 14 days are not shown due to revised data being submitted to the City of Chicago during this period. The reported violations are those that have been collected by the camera system and reviewed by two separate City contractors. In some instances, due to the inability the registered owner of the offending vehicle, the violation may not be issued as a citation. However, this dataset contains all violations regardless of whether a citation was actually issued, which provides an accurate view into the Red Light Program.  Because of occasional time lags between the capturing of a potential violation and the processing and determination of a violation, as well as the occasional revision of the determination of a violation, this data may change. More information on the Red Light Program can be found here: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/red-light_cameraenforcement.html.  The corresponding dataset for speed camera violations is https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/hhkd-xvj4."
275,Violence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated,"This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January ��� March, April ��� June, July ��� September, October ��� December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.

This dataset includes a "" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I "" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (""Y""), No (""N""), or Unknown (""UKNOWN."") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the ""shooting"" column will read either ""Y"" or ""N"" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as ���Y.��� Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with ""UNKNOWN"" in the shooting column.

The dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.

How does this dataset classify victims?

The methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:

Homicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table. 

To determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset. 

For a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Victims dataset"

The Rat Information Portal (RIP) is a web-based mapping application where users can view rat inspection data. 

Data sources: NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), Division of Environmental Health Pest Control Database

Notes on data limitations: Please note that if a property/taxlot does not appear in the file, that does not indicate an absence of rats - rather just that it has not been inspected. Similarly, neighborhoods with higher numbers properties with active rat signs may not actually have higher rat populations but simply have more inspections.

301,COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Given to San Franciscans by Demographics Over Time,"<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
This dataset represents doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in California to San Francisco residents over time. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). The data are broken down by multiple demographic stratifications. As of December 21, 2021, four dose types are counted separately, i.e.  (1) first doses administered as a part of a two-dose primary vaccination series, (2) second doses administered as part of a two-dose primary vaccination series, and (3) single-dose vaccines administered as part of a one-dose primary series, and (4) booster doses regardless of primary vaccine type.

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
Information on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the <a href=""https://cairweb.org/about-cair/"">California Immunization Registry (CAIR)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The information on individuals��� city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration.

In order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide <a href=""https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=popualtion%20age&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S0101&hidePreview=false"">the same 2019 five-year American Community Survey population estimates</a> that are used in <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations-Progress/7mye-zncy/"">our public dashboards</a>. 

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updated daily via automated process

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
Before analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the OVERALL_SEGMENT column.

For example, filtering OVERALL_SEGMENT to ""Ages 5+ by Age Bracket, Administered by All Providers"" will filter the data to residents 5 and over whose vaccinations were administered by any provider. You can then further segment the data and calculate percentages by Age Brackets.

If you filter OVERALL_SEGMENT to ""Ages 65+ by Race/Ethnicity, Administered by DPH Only"", you will see the race/ethnicity breakdown for residents aged 65+ who received vaccinations from San Francisco���s Department of Public Health (DPH)."

This is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/reopening-chicago.html#reopeningmetrics.

For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.

The National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), a collaboration among CDC, federal partners, local and state health departments, and academic and private sector partners, is used to capture information during an Emergency Department (ED) visit.  ED data can include information that are collected before cases are diagnosed or laboratory results are confirmed, providing an early warning system for infections, like COVID-19. 

This dataset includes reports of COVID-19-Like illness (CLI) and COVID-19 diagnosed during an ED visit. CLI is defined as fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without the presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits meeting the CLI definition that also have mention of flu or influenza are excluded. 

This dataset also includes ED visits among persons who have been diagnosed or laboratory confirmed to have COVID-19. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 diagnoses counts are artificially low, due to varying eligibility requirements and availability of testing.

Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health best practices migrated from focusing on CLI to focusing on diagnosed cases. This dataset originally contained only CLI columns. In June 2021, the diagnosis columns were added, back filled to the start of the pandemic but with the caveat noted above. Roughly simultaneously, updating of the CLI columns was discontinued, although previously existing data were kept. Reflecting the new columns, the name of the dataset was changed from ���COVID-Like Illness (CLI) Emergency Department Visits��� to ���COVID-Like Illness (CLI) and COVID-19 Diagnosis Emergency Department Visits��� at the same time.

This dataset is produced by assigning Census tracts to neighborhoods based on existing neighborhood definitions used by Planning and MOHCD. A qualitative assessment is made to identify the appropriate neighborhood for a given tract based on an understanding of population distribution and significant landmarks. Once all tracts have been assigned a neighborhood, the tracts are combined to produce Analysis Neighborhoods which is available at https://data.sfgov.org/d/p5b7-5n3h"

341,311 Service Requests - Pot Holes Reported - Historical,"As described in http://bit.ly/311HistoricalPost, the function of this dataset was replaced by https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/v6vf-nfxy. This dataset is historical-only.

The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  

If a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of ""Duplicate (Open)"".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of ""Duplicate (Open)"".

Once the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read ���Completed��� for the original request and ""Duplicate (Closed)"" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of ���Completed��� when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a ���cave-in��� or ���failed utility cut���, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. 

Data Owner: Transportation. Time Period: All open requests and all completed requests since January 1, 2011. Frequency: Data is updated daily."

Each record represents the approximate location, ownership, and physical type of a single refuse litter basket.
The data can be used as an approximate assessment of the locations of litter baskets tracked by the Department of Sanitation in NYC.
""Litter basket locations are subject to frequent change, for reasons that include but are not limited to: litter basket damage, nearby construction, graffiti, or regular illegal use of basket for household or commercial waste. There is often a lag time between a change in basket type or location and the reflection of that change in this dataset.

This dataset includes information of BID-owned and Privately-owned litter baskets.  Non-profit and private entities wishing to place a litter basket on a public street must receive permission from the Department of Sanitation. Location data for these baskets may be less accurate than for baskets that are owned by DSNY.

469,"108"" Inundation Vulnerability Zone Line (Sea Level Rise + 100YR Flood Event)","Disclaimer: The Sea Level Rise (SLR) map shows the most extreme level of SLR possible. It is a very, very unlikely scenario that would only occur if no efforts to address SLR occur and both a King Tide and 100-year storm occur at the same time. The real purpose of the maps is to provide a broad net to help the City identify projects that that may be vulnerable. The data is based on what was in the ground as of 2010 and doesn���t include piers. _x000D_
_x000D_
The inundation maps and the associated analyses are intended as planning level tools to illustrate the potential for inundation and coastal flooding under a variety of future sea level rise and storm surge scenarios. The maps depict possible future inundation that could occur if nothing is done to adapt or prepare for sea level rise over the next century. The maps do not represent the exact location or depth of flooding. The maps relied on a 1-m digital elevation model created from LiDAR data collected in 2010 and 2011. Although care was taken to capture all relevant topographic features and coastal structures that may impact coastal inundation, it is possible that structures narrower than the 1-m horizontal map scale may not be fully represented. The maps are based on model outputs and do not account for all of the complex and dynamic San Francisco Bay processes or future conditions such as erosion, subsidence, future construction or shoreline protection upgrades, or other changes to San Francisco Bay or the region that may occur in response to sea level rise. For more context about the maps and analyses, including a description of the data and methods used, please see the Climate Stressors and Impacts Report: Bayside Sea Level Rise Inundation Mapping Technical Memorandum, July 2014._x000D_

546,Dwelling Unit Completion Counts by Building Permit,"A. SUMMARY 

This dataset reports the number of new residential units made available for occupancy in San Francisco since January 2018. Each row in this dataset shows the change in the number of new units associated with a building permit application. Each row also includes the date those units were approved for occupancy, the type of document approving them, and their address.

Values in the column [Number of Units Certified] can be added together to produce a count of new units approved for occupancy since January 2018. 

These records provide a preliminary count of new residential units. The San Francisco Planning Department issues a Housing Inventory Report each year that provides a more complete account of new residential units, and those results may vary slightly from records in this dataset. The Housing Inventory Report is an in-depth annual research project requiring extensive work to validate information about projects. By comparison, this dataset is meant to provide more timely updates about housing production based on available administrative data. The Department of Building Inspection and Planning Department will reconcile these records with future Housing Inventory Reports.

B. METHODOLOGY 

At the end of each month, DBI staff manually calculate how many new units are available for occupancy for each building permit application and enters that information into this dataset. These records reflect counts for all types of residential units, including authorized accessory dwelling units. These records do not reflect units demolished or removed from the city���s available housing stock.

Multiple records may be associated with the same building permit application number, which means that new certifications or amendments were issued. Only changes to the net number of units associated with that permit application are recorded in subsequent records. 

For example, Building Permit Application Number [201601010001] located at [123 1st Avenue] was issued an [Initial TCO] Temporary Certificate of Occupancy on [January 1, 2018] approving 10 units for occupancy. Then, an [Amended TCO] was issued on [June 1, 2018] approving [5] additional units for occupancy, for a total of 15 new units associated with that Building Permit Application Number. The building will appear as twice in the dataset, each row representing when new units were approved.

If additional or amended certifications are issued for a building permit application, but they do not change the number of units associated with that building permit application, those certifications are not recorded in this dataset. For example, if all new units associated with a project are certified for occupancy under an Initial TCO, then the Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) would not appear in the dataset because the CFC would not add new units to the housing stock.
See data definitions for more details.

C. UPDATE FREQUENCY 

This dataset is updated monthly.

D. DOCUMENT TYPES

Several documents issued near or at project completion can certify units for occupation. They are: Initial Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO), Amended TCO, and Certificate of Final Completion (CFC). 

���	Initial TCO is a document that allows for occupancy of a unit before final project completion is certified, conditional on if the unit can be occupied safely. The TCO is meant to be temporary and has an expiration date. This field represents the number of units certified for occupancy when the TCO is issued. 
���	Amended TCO is a document that is issued when the conditions of the project are changed before final project completion is certified. These records show additional new units that have become habitable since the issuance of the Initial TCO. 
���	Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) is a document that is issued when all work is completed according to approved plans, and the building is ready for complete occupancy. These records show additional new units that were not accounted for in the Initial o"

578,Beach Lab Data,"The Chicago Park District collects and analyzes water samples from beaches along Chicago���s Lake Michigan lakefront. The Chicago Park District partners with the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Public Health Laboratory to analyze water samples using a new DNA testing method called Rapid Testing Method (qPCR analysis) which tests for Enterococci in order to monitor swimming safety. 
 
The rapid testing method (qPCR analysis) is a new method that measures levels of pathogenic DNA in beach water. Unlike the culture based test that requires up to 24 hours of processing, the new rapid testing method requires a 4-5 hours for results. The Chicago Park District can use results of the rapid test to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 1000* CCE. When DNA bacteria levels exceed 1000 CCE, a yellow swim advisory flag is implemented. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria (http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/criteria/health/recreation).
 
Historically, the Chicago Park District used the culture based analysis method and statistical prediction models to monitor beach water quality. 
The culture based method tests for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria which is an indicator species for the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that may pose health risks to the public. This method requires 18-24 hours of processing to receive results. The Chicago Park District would use results of the culture based method to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 235* CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented. This standard is still used at most beaches throughout the Great Lakes region. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria.
 
The statistical prediction model forecasted real-time Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria levels present in the water. The Chicago Park District (CPD) in partnership with the US Geological Survey, developed statistical prediction models by using weather data pulled from CPD buoys (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku) and weather stations (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75). The Chicago Park District would use results of the predictive model to notify the public when bacteria levels would exceed 235 CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented.
 
* The unit of measurement for Escherichia coli is Colony Forming Units (CFU) per 100 milliliters of water. (Culture Based Method / Statistical Prediction Model)
*The unit of measuring DNA is Enterococci Calibrator Cell Equivalents (CCE) per 100 milliliters of water. (Rapid Testing Analysis)"
579,COVID-19 Daily Vaccinations - Administered in Chicago,"COVID-19 vaccinations administered at sites in the City of Chicago, as reported by medical providers in Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). In contrast to some other COVID-19 vaccination datasets, this one focuses on vaccinations given within the City of Chicago, rather than necessarily those given to people who live in Chicago. _x000D_
_x000D_
Daily counts are shown for the total number of doses administered, first dose, and second dose, as well as cumulative totals as of that date. Initial vaccines required two doses of vaccine to be administered over a period of time specific to each vaccine brand. At least one future vaccine only required one dose to be considered fully vaccinated. While these doses completed the series, additional doses have been approved for some situations and are included in the Total Doses columns._x000D_

Vaccinations are counted based on the day the vaccine was administered.  _x000D_

The plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability._x000D_

The City set caps (limits) on the number of Tobacco Retail Dealer and Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer licenses in each Community District established under Chapter 69 of the New York City Charter.

The City set caps (limits) on the number of Tobacco Retail Dealer and Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer licenses in each Community District established under Chapter 69 of the New York City Charter. The caps are 50 percent of the number of active Tobacco Retail Dealer licenses on February 24, 2018 and 50 percent of the number of licenses issued for Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealer as of August 23, 2018. The cap for Tobacco Retail Dealers excludes pharmacies whose licenses permanently expire before January 1, 2019 when pharmacies and businesses that contain pharmacies can no longer sell cigarettes or other tobacco products in New York City. 

The number of active licenses are grouped by borough and community district number. Each row of data represents one Community District's license cap and the number of active licenses at the time of the dataset's publication.

Businesses interested in applying for these licenses may use this dataset to determine if licenses are available in their Community District. Even if licenses are not available, businesses may be able to apply if they meet limited exceptions to the cap. Visit nyc.gov/dcwp for license requirements."

637,Landcover Raster Data (2010) ��� 3ft Resolution,"High resolution land cover data set for New York City.  This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.  At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF), although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency.  The methods used were developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, in collaboration with the New York City Urban Field Station, with funding from the USDA Forest Service."

675,Dig Ticket Notifications,"In order to help contractors and private residents avoid existing utility lines (including gas, electrical, and water lines) when digging, the Chicago Department of Transportation maintains 811 Chicago, a free, 24-hour service to private contractors and homeowners in Chicago. Anyone planning to dig within Chicago must obtain a ���dig ticket��� from 811 Chicago. 811 Chicago notifies all utilities of the impending excavations. The utility owners then send out staff to mark the location of the underground facilities within 48 hours (excluding emergencies), not counting Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. 

This dataset shows these utility notifications. Since it is common for the same dig ticket to produce multiple notifications, the same dig ticket will appear multiple times and this dataset cannot be used without further refinement to count, map, or analyze unique excavations in Chicago.

See https://ipi.cityofchicago.org/Digger for more information on the dig ticket system."

680,311 Service Requests - Street Lights - All Out - Historical,"As described in http://bit.ly/311HistoricalPost, the function of this dataset was replaced by https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/v6vf-nfxy. This dataset is historical-only.

All open reports of ""Street Lights - All Out"" (an outage of 3 or more lights) made to 311 and all requests completed since January 1, 2011.The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees approximately 250,000 street lights that illuminate arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residents��� reports of street light outages. 
 
Whenever CDOT receives a report of an ���All Out��� the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure that they are all working properly. If a second request of lights out in the same circuit is made within four calendar days of the original request, the newest request is automatically given the status of ���Duplicate (Open).��� Since CDOT's electrician will be looking at all the lights in a circuit to verify that they are all working, any ���Duplicate (Open)��� address will automatically be observed and repaired. 
 
Once the street lights are repaired, the status in CSR will read ���Completed��� for the original request and ���Duplicate (Closed)��� for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of ���Completed��� when the reported lights are inspected but found to be in good repair and functioning; when the service request is for a non-existent address; or when the lights are maintained by a contractor. Data is updated daily."
681,Vendor Payments (Vouchers),"The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of payments made to vendors from fiscal year 2007 forward. This data is presented on the Vendor Payments report hosted at http://openbook.sfgov.org, and is also available in this dataset in CSV format, which represents detailed data by voucher. We have removed sensitive information from this data ��� this is intended to show payments made to entities providing goods and services to the City and County and to protect individuals. For example, we have removed payments to employees (reimbursements, garnishments) and jury members, revenue refunds, payments for judgments and claims, witnesses, relocation and rehousing, and a variety of human services payments. New data is added on a weekly basis.

City Department spending may occur three ways: 1) from Contract to Purchase Order (i.e. a PO with an accounting Encumbrance) to Payment (i.e. an accounting Voucher), AKA On-Contract spending, 2) direct-to-Purchase Order (no contract, only a PO agreement and accounting Encumbrance) to Payment, and 3) Direct Voucher Payment (for limited one-time, non-recurring payments, e.g. a membership or a subscription).  Therefore, it is helpful to use both the Supplier Contracts and Supplier Payments reports on SFOpenBook, as well as on DataSF.

Supplier payments represent payments to City contractors and vendors that provide goods and/or services to the City. Certain other non-supplier payee payments, which are made to parties other than traditional City contractors and vendors, are also included in this dataset, These include payments made for tax and fee refunds, rebates, settlements, etc."

686,Covid-19 Testing by Geography and Date,"<i><b>Note: As of April 16, 2021, this dataset will update daily with a five-day data lag.</i></b>

<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
This dataset includes COVID-19 tests by resident neighborhood and specimen collection date (the day the test was collected). Specifically, this dataset includes tests of San Francisco residents who listed a San Francisco home address at the time of testing. These resident addresses were then geo-located and mapped to neighborhoods. The resident address associated with each test is hand-entered and susceptible to errors, therefore neighborhood data should be interpreted as an approximation, not a precise nor comprehensive total.

In recent months, about 5% of tests are missing addresses and therefore cannot be included in any neighborhood totals. In earlier months, more tests were missing address data. Because of this high percentage of tests missing resident address data, this neighborhood testing data for March, April, and May should be interpreted with caution (see below)

Percentage of tests missing address information, by month in 2020
Mar - 33.6%
Apr - 25.9%
May - 11.1%
Jun - 7.2%
Jul - 5.8%
Aug - 5.4%
Sep - 5.1%
Oct (Oct 1-12) - 5.1%

To protect the privacy of residents, the City does not disclose the number of tests in neighborhoods with resident populations of fewer than 1,000 people. These neighborhoods are omitted from the data (they include Golden Gate Park, John McLaren Park, and Lands End).

Tests for residents that listed a Skilled Nursing Facility as their home address are not included in this neighborhood-level testing data. Skilled Nursing Facilities have required and repeated testing of residents, which would change neighborhood trends and not reflect the broader neighborhood's testing data.

This data was de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). 

<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco. </strong>During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some people in San Francisco may be tested multiple times (which is common). To see the number of new confirmed cases by neighborhood, reference this map: https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/Map-of-Cumulative-Cases/adm5-wq8i#new-cases-map

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
COVID-19 laboratory test data is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information. All testing data is then geo-coded by resident address. Then data is aggregated by <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h
"">analysis neighborhood</a> and specimen collection date.

Data are prepared by close of business Monday through Saturday for public display.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. 

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
Due to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. 

In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by ""specimen_collection_date"".

Calculating Percent Positivity: The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that return a positive result for COVID-19 (positive tests divided by the sum of positive and negative tests). Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Percent positivity indicates how widesprea"

702,DSNY Waste Characterization: Mainsort,"The Department conducted the 2017 NYC Residential, School, and NYCHA (NYC Housing Authority) Waste Characterization Study over three seasons: spring, summer, and fall. This study builds on decades of research and analysis into the evolving composition of NYC's waste stream. The study team hand sorted samples into 70 main sort categories. Sub-sorting of an additional 172 categories was conducted to get a more detailed understanding of the wide variety of plastic products in the waste stream, as well as a sub-set of Paper products. Results are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type. The quantity of each materials is calculated by applying the percent composition to the total quantity of DSNY collections for fiscal year 2017 (July 2016-June 2017). 

The residential characterization included four residential curbside collection streams: Refuse, Paper, MGP (metal/glass/plastic), and Organics. 
The school characterization included Refuse, Paper, and MGP streams collected on dedicated school collection routes. For the purposes of this study, DSNY did not characterize Organics separated for diversion but instead included organic waste in the school Refuse stream. The NYCHA characterization focused sample collection from the large compacting containers used by DSNY to collect Refuse at NYCHA's large campus-style developments.

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
Dataset is exported manually by staff from internal collections database and re-formatted manually by staff.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Dataset is updated as needed manually by staff.

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
Artworks may be located at a specific addresses (traditional building number, street name format) or other locations (City Parks, Piers, SFO, etc.) that don't meet the traditional address format; in these cases, the closest intersection or building address has been used. Please look at the ""Location Description"" field for the location of the artwork (floor 2, International terminal, Northwest corner, etc.). An individual artwork can consist of a single piece or multiple pieces, this will be reflected in the last part of it's accession number with either a letter or number (i.e. 1904.2.a-b or 1999.22.1-2). A single artwork may have multiple entries, one for each part, or may have a single group entry. Therefore, the number of entries is not equivalent to the number of artworks. Generally, if an artworks' pieces are spread out over a distance, each piece will have an entry and if they are grouped at one location, there will be one group entry. When an artwork spans multiple blocks one end point was chosen for the address/map point. The data column ""number_of_districts"" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in. If a mural is in more than Cultural Districts, the districts will be listed in the ""Cultural_District"" column and separated by a semicolon. This is because cultural districts can overlap."

For each day, this dataset represents the daily count of tests collected by race/ethnicity, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Tests in this dataset include all tests collected from San Francisco residents who listed a San Francisco home address at the time of testing, and tests that were collected in San Francisco but had a missing home address. Data are based on information collected at the time of testing.

For recent data, about 25-30% of tests are missing race/ ethnicity information. Tests where the race/ ethnicity of the patient is unknown are included in the dataset under the ""Unknown"" category.

This data was de-duplicated by individual and date, so if a person gets tested multiple times on different dates, all tests will be included in this dataset (on the day each test was collected). 

<strong>The total number of positive test results is not equal to the total number of COVID-19 cases in San Francisco. </strong>Each positive test result is investigated. During this investigation, some test results are found to be for persons living outside of San Francisco and some people in San Francisco may be tested multiple times. In both cases, these results are not included in San Francisco���s total COVID-19 case count. To track the number of cases by race/ ethnicity, see this dashboard: https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/w6za-6st8

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
COVID-19 laboratory test data is based on electronic laboratory test reports. Deduplication, quality assurance measures and other data verification processes maximize accuracy of laboratory test information. 

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updates automatically at 05:00 Pacific Time each day. Redundant runs are scheduled at 07:00 and 09:00 in case of pipeline failure. 

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
Due to the high degree of variation in the time needed to complete tests by different labs there is a delay in this reporting. On March 24 the Health Officer ordered all labs in the City to report complete COVID-19 testing information to the local and state health departments. 

In order to track trends over time, a data user can analyze this data by ""specimen_collection_date"".

Calculating Percent Positivity: The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that return a positive result for COVID-19 (positive tests divided by the sum of positive and negative tests). Indeterminate results, which could not conclusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. When there are fewer than 20 positives tests for a given race/ethnicity and time period, the positivity rate is not calculated for the public tracker because rates of small test counts are less reliable. 

Calculating Testing Rates: To calculate the testing rate per 10,000 residents, divide the total number of tests collected (positive, negative, and indeterminate results) for the specified race/ ethnicity by the total number of residents who identify as that race/ ethnicity (according to the <a href=""https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=race%2F%20ethnicity&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true"">2018 5-year estimates from the American Community Survey</a>), then multiply by 10,000. When there are fewer than 20 total tests for a given race/ethnicity and time period, the testing rate is not calculated for the public tracker because rates of small test counts are less reliable.

_x000D_
The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago���s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O���Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions. Current estimates of traffic congestion by region are available at http://bit.ly/Vz3rIh."

The WFLS also sought to describe the role that paid family leave policies play in achieving health equity for parents and children.  The WFLS was made possible through funding by the U.S. Department of Labor Women���s Bureau."

782,311 Service Requests - Graffiti Removal - Historical,"As described in http://bit.ly/311HistoricalPost, the function of this dataset was replaced by https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/v6vf-nfxy. This dataset is historical-only.

All open graffiti removal requests made to 311 and all requests completed since January 1, 2011. The Department of Streets & Sanitation's Graffiti Blasters crews offer a vandalism removal service to private property owners. Graffiti Blasters employ ""blast"" trucks that use baking soda under high water pressure to erase painted graffiti from brick, stone and other mineral surfaces. They also use paint trucks to cover graffiti on the remaining surfaces. Organizations and residents may report graffiti and request its removal.
311 sometimes receives duplicate requests for graffiti removal. Requests that have been labeled as Duplicates are in the same geographic area and have been entered into 311���s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system at around the same time as a previous request. Duplicate reports/requests are labeled as such in the Status field, as either ""Open - Dup"" or ""Completed - Dup."" Data is updated daily."

Because the Chicago building code has since 1975 required new high-rise residential buildings to be constructed with sprinkler systems, the Life Safety Ordinance mostly impacted high-rise residential buildings constructed prior to 1975.  This dataset does not describe the overall safety of a building, only whether or not the life safety evaluation was submitted and approved by the City of Chicago.

787,SFPUC 100-Year Storm Flood Hazard Zone,"This shapefile (polygon feature) contains the boundary of the July 1, 2019 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone, one of the layers of the July 1, 2019 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map. The latest adoption FRRM flood map was adopted on July 2020. This adoption was also based on the July 2019 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map analysis because this represents the latest analysis of the floodplain. No changes have occurred in the geographic extent of the flood plain map since 2019.

Areas within this boundary are highly likely to experience ���deep and contiguous��� flooding during a 100-year storm. A 100-year storm is a storm that has a 1% chance of occurring in a given year. ���Deep and contiguous flooding��� means flooding at least 6-inches deep spanning an area at least the size of half an average City block. The 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone does not provide the exact depth of flooding at a given location. It also does not show areas in the City that may experience shallower and/or more localized flooding in a 100-year storm, or areas of the City that may flood in storms larger than a 100-year storm. Finally, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone shows flood risk from storm runoff only. It does not consider flood risk in San Francisco from other causes such as inundation from the San Francisco Bay or Pacific Ocean. In addition to the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Zone, the 100-Year Storm Flood Risk Map shows other layers. The layer ���Areas not served by the Combined Sewer and Stormwater Collection System��� shows where data for rainfall driven storm runoff is not available. A group of historical hydrology layers illustrate the general topography of low-lying areas in the City ��� ���Historical Shoreline���, ���Historical Creeks���, and ���Historical Waterbodies���."

About the Data_x000D_
_x000D_
All NYC children are required to be tested for lead poisoning at around age 1 and age 2, and to be screened for risk of lead poisoning, and tested if at risk, up until age 6. These data are an indicator of children younger that 6 years of age tested in NYC in a given year with blood lead levels of 5 mcg/dL or greater. In 2012, CDC established that a blood lead level of 5 mcg/dL is the reference level for exposure to lead in children. This level is used to identify children who have blood lead levels higher than most children's levels. The reference level is determined by measuring the NHANES blood lead distribution in US children ages 1 to 5 years, and is reviewed every 4 years."

Official traffic crash data are published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) on a yearly basis. The traffic fatality list determined on an ongoing basis through the year may differ from IDOT���s official crash data for Chicago as IDOT may define the cause and location differently from the FCRCC. Once IDOT publishes its data for a year, crashes in this dataset for that year are edited to match IDOT���s determinations, unless the FCRCC disagrees with the IDOT determination ��� which happens only rarely and usually due to an interpretation of one of the criteria below._x000D_

VZC Traffic Fatalities can be linked with other traffic crash datasets using the ���RD_NO��� or ���Person_ID��� fields._x000D_
_x000D_
The FCRCC defines a ���traffic fatality��� for the purpose of VZC statistics as ""any death caused by a traffic crash, within 30 days of the crash��� and ���involves a motor vehicle.��� Fatalities that meet the VZC definition of a traffic fatality are included in this dataset unless excluded by the criteria below. There may be records in this dataset that do not appear as fatalities in the other datasets._x000D_
_x000D_
The following criteria exclude a death from being considered a ""traffic fatality"" for VZC purposes:_x000D_
_x000D_
1. The Medical Examiner determined that the primary cause of the fatality was not the traffic crash, including:_x000D_
_x000D_
a. The fatality was reported as a suicide based on a police investigation._x000D_
_x000D_
b. The fatality was reported as a homicide in which the ""party at fault"" intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm that caused the victim's death._x000D_
_x000D_
c. The fatality was caused directly and exclusively by a medical condition or where the fatality was not attributable to road user movement on a public roadway. (Note: If a person driving suffers a medical emergency and consequently hit and kills another road user, the other road user is included although the driver suffering a medical emergency is excluded.)_x000D_
_x000D_
2. The crash did not occur within the public right-of-way._x000D_
_x000D_
3. The crash involved a train or such mode of transport within their dedicated right-of-way._x000D_
_x000D_
4. The fatality was on a roadway not under Chicago Police Department jurisdiction, including:_x000D_
_x000D_
a. The fatality was occurred on an expressway. The City of Chicago does not have oversight on the expressway system. However, a fatality on expressway ramps occurring within the City jurisdiction will be counted in Vision Zero Chicago Traffic Fatalities._x000D_
_x000D_
b. The fatality occurred outside City limits. Crashes on streets along the City boundary may be assigned to another jurisdiction after the investigation if it is determined that the crash started or substantially occurred on the side of the street that is outside the City limits. Jurisdiction of streets along the City boundary are split between City and neighboring jurisdictions along the street center line._x000D_
_x000D_
5. The fatality is not for a person (e.g., an animal)."

930,NYC Urban Tree Canopy Assessment Metrics 2010,"Tree Canopy (TC) Assessment metrics for New York City.  This dataset consists of TC metrics summarized to several different sets of geographic base layers. The metrics presented in this table are based on 2010 high resolution land cover dataset._x000D_
_x000D_
The TC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the forest.  Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing TC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible TC). _x000D_
_x000D_
Existing TC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset.  Possible TC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist.  Possible TC in a GIS context is determined by overlaying high resolution land cover with cadastral and planimetric datasets to include building polygons and road polygons.  _x000D_
_x000D_
Possible TC is queried out from this overlay and consists of all land that was not existing canopy, not water, not a building, and not a road.  Possible TC is further divided into two subcategories:  Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation.  Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy.  Examples of such features are parking lots, driveways (through overhanging coverage) and playgrounds.  Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy.  Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields.  TC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees.  Rather, the TC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions.   _x000D_
_x000D_
TC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in map units) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel.  For example, an Existing TC Area (TC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing TC Percentage (TC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing TC is 13,677 (in map units) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy.   This assessment was completed by the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory with funding from National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF) and in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station._x000D_
_x000D_
The TC Assessment protocols were developed by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station and the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  TC assessments have been conducted for numerous communities throughout the U.S. where the results have been instrumental in helping to establishing TC goals."

This dataset is derived from <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Parcels-Active-and-Retired/acdm-wktn"">parcels</a> and several other overlay administrative boundaries (listed below). The dataset was developed by DataSF as a convenience for matching parcels to districts where appropriate. This can be simpler than running a geospatial process every time you want to join parcels to a boundary. The districts provided here run along streets and are non-overlapping so that the parcels will be contained within a single district.

The boundaries included are:
1. <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h"">Analysis Neighborhoods</a>
2. <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Current-Supervisor-Districts/8nkz-x4ny"">Supervisor Districts</a>
3. <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Current-Police-Districts/wkhw-cjsf"">Police Districts</a>
4. <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Planning-Districts/ttns-6zj3"">Planning Districts</a>

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
A script runs daily that overlays parcels with each of the boundaries to produce the composite dataset.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updated daily by a script based on the upstream parcels dataset which is also updated daily.

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
You can use this dataset to match to administrative districts provided here to datasets that contain a parcel number. This can be a simpler process than running these joins spatially. 

In short, we pre-process the spatial overlays to make joins simpler and more performant."

DSNY is responsible for the removal of snow and ice from all New York City highways and streets during and post snow storms. Salt usage data is collected daily during a snow event.  DSNY spreading equipment holds 16 tons of salt.The amount of salt dispensed onto roadways is calculated based on the number of times a piece of equipment is reloaded throughout a storm citywide. Each record represents amount of salt dispensed from salt sites during a specific time period. DSNY uses salt usage data for tracking, planning, and purchasing purchases.Tracking salt usage gives DSNY a clear picture of each Borough���s usage percentage of the commodity.Some decisions that can be made with this data are:_x000D_
- DSNY is able to make decisions on which Borough has an increased need based on their respective usage._x000D_
- DSNY is able to make decisions on which Borough has a lesser need based on their respective usage._x000D_
- Which Borough may be in need of more salt storage facilities._x000D_
- Which Borough needs more frequent deliveries for replenishment post storm. _x000D_
At this time DSNY does not have any type of technology incorporated to track salt usage therefore there is always a chance of errors being made during data collection."

984,"License Revocations, Suspensions, Surrenders and Reinstatements","This dataset features DCA licenses that have been revoked, suspended, or surrendered  as well as licenses that have been reinstated, if applicable.</br></p>

Licenses can be suspended or revoked for several reasons including, an order by the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings; non-payment of fines and/or fees; or not maintaining a license requirement such as a current driver���s license or insurance coverage.

Licenses are typically surrendered when a business closes, changes ownership, changes location, changes business name, or discontinues the activity that required the license.</br>

Licenses can be reinstated based on appeal of a revocation, expiration of a suspension, or new application after surrendering it.</br>

Each record in the dataset represents a time that a license was revoked, suspended, surrendered, or reinstated so a license can appear more than once.

This dataset can be linked to other DCA datasets using the DCA License Number column. This dataset cannot be linked to an administrative hearing decision or provide a specific reason for the change in status."
985,SPP Average CLASS Scores,"This data set shows the CLASS PreK assessment scores for Seattle Preschool Program (SPP) classrooms overtime, compared to two benchmark programs: Head Start or Early Achievers and SPP's overall goal. The SPP scores only include non-Family Child Care providers.

The CLASS PreK is an assessment tool used to rate classroom practices in preschool by measuring the interactions between children and adults. It is one of the assessments that contribute to a provider agency���s Early Achievers rating. CLASS is widely used in Pre-K classrooms as it describes multiple dimensions of teaching that are linked to student achievement and development, and it has been validated in over 2,000 classrooms. 

The teaching practices assessed are grouped into three domains: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization and Instructional Support. CLASS uses a 7-point rating scale. A score of 1 or 2 indicates low range quality; a score of 6 or 7 indicates high-quality.

991,Dig Tickets,"In order to help contractors and private residents avoid existing utility lines (including gas, electrical, and water lines) when digging, the Chicago Department of Transportation maintains 811 Chicago, a free, 24-hour service to private contractors and homeowners in Chicago. Anyone planning to dig within Chicago must obtain a ���dig ticket��� from 811 Chicago. 811 Chicago notifies all utilities of the impending excavations. The utility owners then send out staff to mark the location of the underground facilities within 48 hours (excluding emergencies), not counting Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.<br><br>_x000D_
_x000D_
The dataset on which this filtered view is based shows these utility notifications. Since it is common for the same dig ticket to produce multiple notifications, the same dig ticket will appear multiple times and the dataset cannot be used without further refinement to count, map, or analyze unique excavations in Chicago.<br><br>_x000D_
_x000D_
This filtered view shows only the columns that should remain constant for a dig ticket and de-duplicates them, Therefore, it should represent a unique list of dig tickets. Because of the technique used, while it is possible to show the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE columns, it is not possible to show the LOCATION column and therefore not possible to create map views directly from this filtered view within the data portal software.<br><br>_x000D_

Some agencies distribute voter registration applications during the course of a direct interaction with a member of the public and other agencies distribute applications passively, such as making the applications available in waiting rooms. This makes it difficult in some cases to ascertain the exact number of voter registration forms distributed. Applications sent to the Board of Elections only captures those sent by agency staff. Individuals may also choose to send in the application themselves. These applications are not counted towards the total number of applications sent to the Board of Elections._x000D_

997,Police Sentiment Scores,"This dataset was used by Chicago Police Department analysts to create the publicly available ���Chicago Police Sentiment Dashboard��� (https://home.chicagopolice.org/statistics-data/data-dashboards/sentiment-dashboard/). This online dashboard displays information related to how safe Chicago residents feel and how much trust they have in the police.

The dashboard and this dataset are updated monthly and users are able to view data citywide, as well as within the five detective areas and in each of the 22 districts. Users can sort this data based on year, month and location. Information is also available based on demographics, including age, sex, race, education and income level. The dashboard is meant to improve transparency as well as work toward compliance with the consent decree.

The first five columns indicate the type of organizational unit described by the records and which particular unit. Subsequent columns show either a safety or trust score for a demographic group. Scores are derived from responses to survey questions, with each response being a value that ranges from 0-10. Please note that Elucd trust and safety scores are NOT a percentage. A score of 65 means that average response to the questions is 6.5 out of 10. The final two columns show the time period in which the data were collected.

The dataset was created by our partner, Elucd (https://elucd.com), through delivering short surveys to Chicago residents through digital ads. See [https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard_FAQ_11_25_20.pdf] for more information on the project.

This effort is one element of a Chicago Police Department reform process, governed by a consent decree executed between the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois (OAG) and the City of Chicago. For more information on the consent decree, see https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/police-reform/home/consent-decree.html."

1036,SFEC Form 3410B - Quarterly Report for Permit Consultants Filings,"Effective January 1, 2015, an individual who qualifies as a permit consultant under San Francisco law must register and file quarterly reports with the Ethics Commission. A permit consultant is an individual who receives or is promised compensation to provide permit consulting services on a ""major project"" or a ""minor project"", including any employee who receives compensation for time spent on permit consulting services. 

""Permit consulting services"" means any contact with the Department of Building Inspection, the Entertainment Commission, the Planning Department, or the Department of Public Works to help a permit applicant obtain a permit. ""Permit consulting services"" do not include simple requests for information which do not otherwise include attempts to help obtain a permit. 

A ""major project"" is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 and which requires a permit issued by the Department of Building Inspection or the Planning Department. Estimated constructions costs are to be calculated in the same manner used to determine building permit fees under the Building Code. A ""minor project"" is a project located in the City and County of San Francisco which requires a permit issued by the Entertainment Commission.

The following individuals are not permit consultants and thus are not required to register or report: 
-a licensed architect or engineer of record for construction activity allowed or contemplated by the permit, or an employee of that architect or engineer; 
-a contractor who will be responsible for all construction activity associated with the requested permit, or an employee of that contractor; or 
-an employee or agent of an organization with tax exempt status under 26 United States Code Section 501(c)(3) communicating on behalf of that organization regarding the development of a project for that organization. 

Each permit consultant must register with the Ethics Commission no later than five business days after providing permit consulting services. Quarterly disclosure reports must subsequently be filed with the Ethics Commission"

Idiosyncrasies or Limitations: _x000D_
Note that while the dataset contains the total number of individuals who have identified their ancestry or languages spoke, because such data is collected anonymously, there may be instances of a single individual completing multiple voluntary surveys. Additionally, the survey being both voluntary and anonymous has advantages as well as disadvantages: it increases the likelihood of full and honest answers, but since it is not connected to the individual case, it does not directly inform delivery of services to the applicant. The paper and online versions of the survey ask the same questions but free-form text is handled differently. Free-form text fields are expected to be entered in English although the form is available in several languages. Surveys are presented in 11 languages.  _x000D_

Your first contact should be your health care provider, including your primary care provider, health clinic, or hospital where you have gotten medical care in the past. Check your provider���s website, electronic application (e.g., MyChart), or office recorded message for details on vaccine availability. Providers are also reaching out directly to schedule appointments with their existing patients, prioritizing those who are older with more underlying conditions. Check the details associated with each provider prior to calling or showing up at the office or pharmacy.

There is a phased roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine in Chicago with a very limited supply, so certain groups are prioritized. Currently, vaccination is available by appointment only for eligible individuals. The vaccine will be offered at no cost to all Chicagoans who want it, but patience is needed while vaccine quantities increase. Learn more about Chicago's vaccination phases and who is currently eligible here: https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/vaccine-distribution-phases.html

This dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report in support of a consent decree executed between the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois (OAG) and the City of Chicago. 

The CPD is currently engaged in a reform process, as governed by that consent decree. A consent decree is a written settlement resolving a legal dispute. The OAG/City of Chicago consent decree includes detailed requirements organized into 11 core areas (e.g., use of force, accountability and transparency), collectively designed to create organizational change within CPD. To review the consent decree and learn more about the process, see the City of Chicago���s police reform webpage: 

https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/police-reform/home/consent-decree.html

This dataset is made available to the public pursuant to consent decree requirements described in Paragraph 79 and Paragraph 80. 

Paragraph 79 of the consent decree states that:
By April 1, 2020, and every year thereafter, CPD will conduct an assessment of the relative frequency of all misdemeanor arrests and administrative notices of violation (���ANOVs���) effectuated by CPD members of persons in specific demographic categories, including race and gender.  

Then, the last sentence of Paragraph 80 states that: 
Upon completion of the assessment, CPD will publish the underlying data, excluding personal identifying information (e.g., name, address, contact information), via a publicly-accessible, web-based data platform. 

This dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report pursuant to Paragraph 79. The report was designed to achieve compliance with Paragraph 79. Each record in the dataset shows information about an ANOV issued by a CPD member. An ANOV is a citation issued for violating a Municipal Code of Chicago ordinance. ANOV���s are adjudicated by the City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings (DOAH). ANOV data are owned and housed by the Department of Administrative Hearings. CPD receives a daily data extraction from the DOAH data system, whereupon ANOV data is ingested into the CPD data system.

To request the aforementioned report contact the CPD Freedom of Information Act Section at https://home.chicagopolice.org/information/freedom-of-information-act-foia.. 

NOV NUMBER is the record identifier for the dataset. Each record in the dataset is a unique, unduplicated citation. 

Users interested in learning more about how CPD handles ANOV citations can review the current policy, using the CPD Automated Directives system (http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/). CPD Special Order S04-22, entitled ���Municipal Administrative Hearings���, provides guidelines for CPD members when issuing an ANOV."

_x000D_
The modeling prediction numbers forecast real-time Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria levels present in the water. The Chicago Park District (CPD) in partnership with the US Geological Survey, has developed statistical prediction models by using weather data pulled from CPD buoys (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku) and weather stations (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75). E. coli is an indicator species for the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that may pose health risks to the public._x000D_
_x000D_
The culture based testing numbers indicate E. coli levels present in the water. This method requires 18-24 hours of processing to receive results. US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommends notifying the public when E. coli bacteria levels are above the federal water quality Beach Action Value (BAV), which is 235*CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow or red flag will be implemented. This standard is used at beaches throughout the Great Lakes region. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria._x000D_
_x000D_
The rapid testing method (qPCR analysis) is a new method that measures levels of pathogenic DNA in beach water. Unlike the culture based test that requires up to 24 hours of processing, the new rapid testing method requires a few hours for results. The Chicago Park District can use results of the rapid test to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels. US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommends notifying the public when DNA bacteria levels are above the federal water quality Beach Action Value (BAV), which is 1000*CCE. When DNA bacteria levels exceed 1000 CCE, a yellow or red flag will be implemented. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria (http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/criteria/health/recreation)._x000D_

_x000D_
The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago���s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O���Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions. Current estimates of traffic congestion by region are available at http://bit.ly/103beCf."

 This workbook provides data and data dictionaries for the SFMTA 2019 Travel Decision Survey.

On behalf of San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Corey, Canapary & Galanis (CC&G) undertook a Mode Share Survey within the City and County of San Francisco as well as the eight surrounding Bay Area counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Marin, Santa Clara, Napa, Sonoma and Solano.

The primary goals of this study were to:
��� Assess percent mode share for travel in San Francisco for evaluation of the SFMTA Strategic Objective 2.2: Mode Share target of 80% sustainable travel by 2030. 
��� Evaluate the above statement based on the following parameters: number of trips to, from, and within San Francisco by Bay Area residents. Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.
��� Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.
��� Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.
��� Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.

The survey was conducted as a telephone study among 801 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tagalog. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.
All survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the ���weight��� field when appropriate in your analysis.

The survey period for this survey is as follows:
2019: May - August 2019

The margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error is 3.3% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.

At the 95% confidence level is:
��� n = 801(Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.3%
��� n = 400. Margin of error = +/- 4.85%
��� n = 100. Margin of error = +/- 9.80%"

This study builds on decades of research and analysis into the evolving composition of NYC's waste stream. DSNY conducted previous waste characterization studies in 1990, 2005, and 2013. Each of these studies share a similar methodology of waste sampling and sorting but also included different targeted analyses to characterize particular components of the waste stream. 

The 2005 study examined residential curbside collection of commingled paper and cardboard recycling (Paper); MGP (metal/glass/plastic); and trash (Refuse) that provided statistical results by housing density and income levels throughout NYC. The 2005 study also included a characterization of the contents of street litter baskets. 
</p>
The 2013 study surveyed residential curbside Paper, MGP, and Refuse collections providing statistical results by borough for the City as a whole, but not by housing density and income levels. The 2013 study also included a detailed characterization of discarded plastics, as well as food and beverage containers. 
</p>
The 2017 study followed the same methodology for residential curbside collections as the 2013 study but included residential curbside collection of organics waste (Organics), NYC's new service to recycle food scraps, food-soiled paper, and yard waste. The 2017 study also characterized collection for both NYC public schools and NYC Housing Authority buildings to create a baseline view of waste generation from these sources. The 2017 study included a detailed analysis of plastics using the same method as the 2013 study. It also included a more detailed analysis of certain paper products.

�����The New York State Education Department adopted Aspirational Performance Measures (APM) in addition to high school graduation rates for the Cohort of 2006 (Class of 2010). In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts. The total number of students in the cohort is the same in June and August. _x000D_

1546,DSNY Waste Characterization: Citywide Subsort,"The Department conducted the 2017 NYC Residential, School, and NYCHA (NYC Housing Authority) Waste Characterization Study over three seasons: spring, summer, and fall. This study builds on decades of research and analysis into the evolving composition of NYC's waste stream. The study team hand sorted samples into 70 main sort categories. Sub-sorting of an additional 172 categories was conducted to get a more detailed understanding of the wide variety of plastic products in the waste stream, as well as a sub-set of Paper products. Results are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type. The quantity of each materials is calculated by applying the percent composition to the total quantity of DSNY collections for fiscal year 2017 (July 2016-June 2017). 
</p>
The residential characterization included four residential curbside collection streams: Refuse, Paper, MGP (metal/glass/plastic), and Organics. 
The school characterization included Refuse, Paper, and MGP streams collected on dedicated school collection routes. For the purposes of this study, DSNY did not characterize Organics separated for diversion but instead included organic waste in the school Refuse stream. The NYCHA characterization focused sample collection from the large compacting containers used by DSNY to collect Refuse at NYCHA's large campus-style developments.

It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: ���	CODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County.

1944,SFEC Form 3410A - Registration Report for Permit Consultants,"Effective January 1, 2015, an individual who qualifies as a permit consultant under San Francisco law must register and file quarterly reports with the Ethics Commission. A permit consultant is an individual who receives or is promised compensation to provide permit consulting services on a ""major project"" or a ""minor project"", including any employee who receives compensation for time spent on permit consulting services. 

""Permit consulting services"" means any contact with the Department of Building Inspection, the Entertainment Commission, the Planning Department, or the Department of Public Works to help a permit applicant obtain a permit. ""Permit consulting services"" do not include simple requests for information which do not otherwise include attempts to help obtain a permit. 

A ""major project"" is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 and which requires a permit issued by the Department of Building Inspection or the Planning Department. Estimated constructions costs are to be calculated in the same manner used to determine building permit fees under the Building Code. A ""minor project"" is a project located in the City and County of San Francisco which requires a permit issued by the Entertainment Commission.

The following individuals are not permit consultants and thus are not required to register or report: 
-a licensed architect or engineer of record for construction activity allowed or contemplated by the permit, or an employee of that architect or engineer; 
-a contractor who will be responsible for all construction activity associated with the requested permit, or an employee of that contractor; or 
-an employee or agent of an organization with tax exempt status under 26 United States Code Section 501(c)(3) communicating on behalf of that organization regarding the development of a project for that organization. 

Each permit consultant must register with the Ethics Commission no later than five business days after providing permit consulting services. Quarterly disclosure reports must subsequently be filed with the Ethics Commission"

_x000D_
There are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: ���	CODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. ���	ST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. ���	CREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. _x000D_

The primary goals of this study were to:_x000D_
��� Assess percent mode share for travel in San Francisco for evaluation of the SFMTA Strategic Objective 2.3: Mode Share target of 50% non-private auto travel by FY2018 with a 95% confidence level and MOE +/- 5% or less._x000D_
��� Evaluate the above statement based on the following parameters:  number of trips to, from, and within San Francisco by Bay Area residents. Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included._x000D_
��� Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series._x000D_
��� Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco._x000D_
��� Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs._x000D_
_x000D_
The survey was conducted as a telephone study among with approximately 750 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, and Cantonese. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample. _x000D_
All three survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the ���weight��� field when appropriate in your analysis. _x000D_

If a second request of lights out in the same circuit is made within four calendar days of the original request, the newest request is automatically given the status of ���Duplicate (Open).��� Since CDOT's electrician will be looking at all the lights in a circuit to verify that they are all working, any ���Duplicate (Open)��� address will automatically be observed and repaired. _x000D_

Once the street lights are repaired, the status in CSR will read ���Completed��� for the original request and ���Duplicate (Closed)��� for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of ���Completed��� when the reported lights are inspected but found to be in good repair and functioning; when the service request is for a non-existent address; or when the lights are maintained by a contractor.

This prohibition does not apply to restaurants, hotels offering restaurant services, or not-for-profit clubs. There are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: ���	CODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County.

This dataset is in ESRI shapefile format. To view or use these files, compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS, is required. This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe���s Worldview-2 satellite. The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite���s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1). The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet."

2966,Micro Community Policing Plans,"<div><p>No two neighborhoods in Seattle are the same. The Micro Community 
Policing Plans (MCPP) were designed to address the distinctive needs of 
each community.���� The plans take a three prong approach that brings 
community engagement, crime data and police services together to get 
direct feedback on perceptions of crime and��public safety. MCPP are 
tailored to meet the individual needs of each community, with a unique 
approach owned by the community.</p>
<strong>Why are Perceptions of Crime Important?</strong>
<p>Citizen perceptions of crime and public safety matter. When used in 
conjunction with crime data, citizen perceptions at the micro-community 
level provide a more accurate picture of the reality of crime and public
 safety than can be seen through crime statistics alone. �� This is what 
makes the MCPP strategy unique.��</p>
<strong>How were the Neighborhoods Defined?</strong>
The MCPP neighborhoods were defined through police-citizen engagement
 including community meetings, focus groups, survey data, and the 
realities of geographic boundaries SPD can use to collect and report on 
events. The MCPPs and their neighborhoods will be routinely reevaluated 
with attention to the ways in which citizens who live in Seattle 
neighborhoods define their communities. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>https://www.seattle.gov/police/community-policing/mcpp</div>"

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
A team of representative City departments from the Healthy Streets Operation Center (Department of Emergency Management, Department of Public Health, Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, Human Rights Commission, San Francisco Police Department, San Francisco Fire Department, and Department of Public Works), SF Homeless Outreach Team, Felton Institute, and community groups and stakeholders was assembled to design and implement a robust Tenderloin Neighborhood Needs Assessment. This assessment was conducted on the morning of April 28, 2020 and consisted of multi-disciplinary teams walking each block of an area of the Tenderloin broken into six geographic zones. These zone locations are shown in the plan, and are mapped in this dataset.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
This is a reference map that will not be updated.

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>

3012,Coffee Shop Reviews,"<p>In linear regression, we used 65 explanatory variables to fit in a multiple linear regression to predict the daily count of ratings and try to figure out whether there is linear relationship between features and response. It turns out that although there existed several significant variables and the total p-value is extremely small, the adjusted R square of the model is 0.01516, which means only 1.516% of the response variable variation that can be explained by this linear model. Moreover, we test the model on the test data, and in order to know how well it could predict whether the app can be invest or not, we set a threshold of 90 percentile to predicted result we get. That is, if the daily rating counts are larger than the 90% quantile, we set it as good to invest, and if it is no more than 90% quantile, we set it as bad to invest. Finally, we can compare the original daily rating count of test data with the data we predicted. It turns out the accuracy rate is 86.74%, which is not low. However, since our data consists of much larger part of ���bad to invest���, accuracy rate is not a good reflection to the accuracy of models. For investors, they prefer to know whether their investment is valuable, thus precision could be a good criteria. Precision measures the proportion of cases identified as positive that are actually positive. The precision is 33.76%. Therefore, it is too low that 66.24% of investment would not be successful.</p>_x000D_

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered.

Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. _x000D_

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, ���cluster��� teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers."

##Indicates how special class is delivered_x000D_
_x000D_
For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. _x000D_
_x000D_
The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. _x000D_

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school.

CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  _x000D_

Effective September 24, 2020, Mayoral Executive Directive 20-02 requires Department Heads to file behested payment Form SFEC-3610(b) and to comply with the City���s behested payment requirements that apply to City elected officials and members of boards and commissions that are contained in Article III, Chapter 6 of the Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code. 

An officer must file Form SFEC-3610(b) any time a behested payment of $1,000 or more is made at his or her behest by an interested party. An ���interested party��� is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.

The filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.

If the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.

If the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.

Finally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.

Each row in this dataset represents information about payors reported in the ""Payors Information"" sub-table of a Form SFEC-3610(b) filed with the Ethics Commission. The parent filing and form data is available in a separate dataset: ""SFEC Form 3610b - City Officer Behested Payment - Filings"" at https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/SFEC-Form-3610b-City-Officer-Behested-Payment-Fili/7vmk-cq9e.

This flexing of the pavement, combined with the melted water and the stress of vehicular traffic, causes pavement to deteriorate and potholes to form.  The Department of Transportation (CDOT) responds to potholes reported through 311���s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system by mapping open pothole requests each morning and routing crews in geographic clusters so as to fill as many potholes as possible per day.  This metric tracks the average number of days CDOT takes to complete pothole repairs per week.   Total number of requests fulfilled per week is also available by mousing over columns.  The target response time for pothole repairs is within 7 days.

This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe���s Worldview-2 satellite.  The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery.  Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite���s paths was required.  These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage)._x000D_

The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs.  A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago.  The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet.  The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1).  The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet."

3167,Chicago Historic Resources Survey - Red and Orange Buildings - KML,"The Chicago Historic Resources Survey (CHRS), completed in 1995, was a decade-long research effort by the City of Chicago to analyze the historic and architectural importance of all buildings, objects, structures, and sites constructed in the city prior to 1940. During 12 years of field work and follow-up research that started in 1983, CHRS surveyors identified approximately 9,900 properties which were considered to have some historic or architectural importance. 
Please note that this CHRS dataset is limited and does not include the entire survey: 

1.	A color-coded ranking system was used to identify historic and architectural significance relative to age, degree of external physical integrity, and level of possible significance. This dataset only includes buildings identified with the two highest color codes: ""Red"" and ""Orange."" Buildings and structures coded ""Red"" or ""Orange"" (unless designated as a Chicago Landmark or located within a Chicago Landmark District) are subject to the City of Chicago���s Demolition-Delay Ordinance (link to: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/demolition_delay.html), adopted by City Council in 2003. 

2.	Only buildings are included in this dataset; structures and objects such as bridges, park structures, monuments and mausoleums, generally are not represented. Likewise, garages, coach houses, and other secondary structures associated with a building may not be consistently depicted or color-coded. If an ���Orange���- or ���Red���-rated building was demolished after 2008, it may still appear in the map. The CHRS occasionally rated only part of a building or part of a group of joined buildings as ���Orange��� or ���Red;��� however the entire building or group of joined buildings may be incorrectly identified as ���Orange��� or ���Red.��� 

Additional information about the CHRS is available at www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/ or by contacting the Historic Preservation Division at (312) 744-3200.

##Indicates how special class is delivered_x000D_
_x000D_
For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. _x000D_
_x000D_
The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. _x000D_
_x000D_
The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, ���cluster��� teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers."

3576,San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database - Historical Ballot Propositions 1907-present,"<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>

The San Francisco Public Library is thrilled to share our dataset from the San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database on DataSF. This dataset contains full text of San Francisco ballot propositions dating back to 1907 and links to digitized PDF versions of the pamphlets for each election. 

Visit SFPL's <a href=""https://sfpl.org/locations/main-library/government-information-center/san-francisco-government/san-francisco-1/san-1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database</a> for a keyword searchable interface and links to Voter Information pamphlets.

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>

San Francisco Public Library received a Library Services and Technology grant to finance the digital scanning and microfilming of the Library's print collection of voter information pamphlets and handbooks for San Francisco municipal elections. Although not complete, the collection dates back to 1907. Approximately 59,000 voter pamphlet pages, including 1,500 propositions, were digitized into PDF files. For some elections, separate pamphlets were created for each voting district or a combination of each voting district and political party, and there is no singular representative pamphlet which includes all of the candidates for that election. As a result, the hard copies of the various pamphlets were bound together to represent that particular election, and this resulted in extra-large digitized versions. 

Because the PDF files of the voter pamphlets are images instead of text, they cannot be searched electronically. San Francisco Public Library staff developed the San Francisco Ballot Propositions Database to provide keyword access to San Francisco propositions, pass/fail outcomes and other information, and links to the full-text PDF Voter Information Pamphlet.
 
<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>

This dataset is updated when the final election results from the <a href=""https://sfelections.sfgov.org/results"">San Francisco Department of Elections</a> are available.

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>

This dataset contains the number and percentage of ballots cast, percentage required to pass, as well as pass/fail outcomes, the full text of each proposition, and a link to a PDF version of the Voter Information Pamphlet for that election, if available."
3577,Beach Lab Data DNA Testing - Graph,"The Chicago Park District tests water samples at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront, which it tests for E. coli in order to monitor swimming safety.  Multiple samples may be taken from a beach and samples may be tested by culture, DNA testing, or both._x000D_
_x000D_
What do these numbers mean? _x000D_
_x000D_
The modeling prediction numbers forecast real-time Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria levels present in the water. The Chicago Park District (CPD) in partnership with the US Geological Survey, has developed statistical prediction models by using weather data pulled from CPD buoys (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku) and weather stations (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75). E. coli is an indicator species for the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that may pose health risks to the public._x000D_
_x000D_
The culture based testing numbers indicate E. coli levels present in the water. This method requires 18-24 hours of processing to receive results. US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommends notifying the public when E. coli bacteria levels are above the federal water quality Beach Action Value (BAV), which is 235*CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow or red flag will be implemented. This standard is used at beaches throughout the Great Lakes region. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria._x000D_
_x000D_
The rapid testing method (qPCR analysis) is a new method that measures levels of pathogenic DNA in beach water. Unlike the culture based test that requires up to 24 hours of processing, the new rapid testing method requires a few hours for results. The Chicago Park District can use results of the rapid test to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels. US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommends notifying the public when DNA bacteria levels are above the federal water quality Beach Action Value (BAV), which is 1000*CCE. When DNA bacteria levels exceed 1000 CCE, a yellow or red flag will be implemented. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria (http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/criteria/health/recreation)._x000D_
_x000D_

3620,Census Tracts 1960,"This boundary file contains historic census tract boundaries for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data and was produced by the Minnesota Population Center as part of the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) project. The NHGIS is an National Science Foundation-sponsored project (Grant No. BCS0094908) to create a digital spatial-temporal database of all available historical US aggregate census materials. The available shapefiles on the NHGIS site represent version 1.0 of historical US census tract boundary files for the 1910-2000 censuses. These electronic census tract boundary files were created by referencing publicly available, printed U.S. Census Bureau maps and considerable care was taken during their production. TIGER/Line spatial features that corresponded to boundaries on these maps were used to construct proper historic boundaries. When a TIGER/Line features was not available, we digitized the historic boundary from a geo-referenced, scanned census map. The boundary files have been checked against currently available historical census aggregate data."
3621,Census Tracts 1990,"<div>Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions 
of a county or equivalent entity that are updated by local participants 
prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's 
Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineates 
census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where 
state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary
 purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units
 for the presentation of statistical data.
Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 
people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually 
covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts 
varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract 
boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a 
long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to 
census. Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or
 merged as a result of substantial population decline. </div>"
3622,Census Block Groups 1990,"Block Groups (BGs) are statistical divisions of census tracts, are generally defined to contain between 600 and 3,000 people, and are used to present data and control block numbering.  A block group consists of clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their four-digit census block number.  For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003, . . ., 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 3 in that census tract.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate, and a regional organization or State Data Center was not available to participate."

3718,Census Tracts 1970,"Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity that are updated by local participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.

Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census.  Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of substantial population decline."

3803,Tree Canopy 2016,"Tree canopy for Seattle, WA, mapped to 2016 ground conditions. Tree canopy was mapped from leaf-off LiDAR collected in the spring of 2016 and leaf-on high-resolution imagery collected in the summer of 2015 to complete this tree canopy cover assessment. Tree canopy cover mapping was carried out using a semi-automated approach that coupled automated feature extraction with manual editing. Automated feature extraction was done using a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment, a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to ensure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Manual corrections carried out on a scale of 1:2,500, followed by a final review for completeness and consistency at a scale of 1:10,000."

Segments have one street name, one address range and one set of segment characteristics. A Segment may have none or multiple alias street names. Segment types included are Freeways, Highways, Streets, Alleys (named only), Railroads, Walkways, and Bike lanes. SNDSEG is a linear feature class representing the SND Segment Feature, with attributes for Street name, Address Range, Alias Street name and segment Characteristics objects.

3883,Census Tracts 1980,"Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity that are updated by local participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.

Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census.  Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of substantial population decline."

delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant 
existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to 
participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable
 set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.
Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 
people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually 
covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts 
varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract 
boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a 
long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to 
census. Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or
 merged as a result of substantial population decline. <br /></div>"

3909,Building Outlines 1999,"<span>�� <div>Building Outlines Derived From 1999 Digital Orthophotos. Delineates building rooflines. Data tables contain peak elevations &amp; building type. The 1999 Bldg data includes the existing buildings from the original 1993 data plus new construction since 1993. Also, demolished buildings were removed from the data, and other changes to buildings, such as additions or partial demolition were reflected.�� NOTE: All buildings that were not added or updated by Triathlon are directly from the 1993 Building data. Therefore most of the 1999 attribute data is actually exactly the same as the 1993 attribute data, including erroneous data. The vendor was not responsible for checking or correcting attribute data associated with existing buildings unless the building vectors required changes. For example, the 1993 orthophotography quality was quite poor in many areas and many buildings were coded as OBS because their outlines were simply not visible enough. With the 1999 orthophotography we now able to clearly make out most details that were not evident in the 1993 orthophotography. So you will see many buildings in the 1999 data coded as OBS that are clearly not obscured.�� The poor quality of the 1993 orthophotography also interferes with sorting out the updated buildings from the old existing bldgs because many of the 1993 bldgs were not put in quite right due to the fuzzy 1993 ortho quality. Many of these existing bldgs ended up being &quot;updated&quot; by Triathlon.</div></span><br />"

3914,Census Blocks 2000,"A census block is the smallest geographic unit used by the 
United States Census Bureau for tabulation of 100-percent data (data 
collected from all houses, rather than a sample of houses). Census 
blocks are grouped into block groups, which are grouped into census 
tracts. There are on average about 39 blocks per block group. Blocks 
typically have a four-digit number; the first number indicates which 
block group the block is in. For example, census block 3019 would be in 
block group 3.
Blocks are typically bounded by streets, roads or creeks. In cities, a 
census block may correspond to a city block, but in rural areas where 
there are fewer roads, blocks may be limited by other features."

3917,Community Reporting Areas,"Community reporting areas (CRAs) are designed to address a gap that existed in city geography. The task of reporting citywide information at a ""community-like level"" across all departments was either not undertaken or it was handled in inconsistent ways across departments. The CRA geography provides a ""common language"" for geographic description of the city for reporting purposes. Therefore, this geography may be used by departments for geographic reporting and tracking purposes, as appropriate. The following criteria for a CRA geography were defined for this effort: -no overlapping areas; -complete coverage of the city; -suitable scale to represent neighborhood areas/conditions; -reasonably stable over time; -consistent with census geography; -relatively easy to use in a data context; -familiar system of common place names; and, -respects neighborhood district geography. The following existing geographies were reviewed during this effort: -neighborhood planning areas (DON); -neighborhood districts (DON/CNC/Neighborhood District Councils); -city sectors/neighborhood plan implementation areas (DON); -urban centers/urban villages (DPD); -population sub-areas (DPD); -Neighborhood Map Atlas (City Clerk); -Census 2000 geography; -topography; and, -various other geographic information sources related to neighborhood areas and common place names.

3921,New Permits 91601,"The Department of Building and Safety issues permits for the construction, remodeling, and repair of buildings and structures in the City of Los Angeles.

3922,Census Blocks 2010,"The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) 
that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information 
from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically 
Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database 
(MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or
 gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand 
alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the 
entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides 
by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad 
tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, 
and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and 
roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block 
in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are
 often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A 
common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used 
geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all 
other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary 
constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the 
tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every
 other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical 
data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the 
appropriate geographic areas. Census blocks cover all territory in the 
United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands). Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census 
Bureau publishes data from the decennial census. A block may consist of 
one or more faces."

tracts. There are on average about 39 blocks per block group. Blocks 
typically have a four-digit number; the first number indicates which 
block group the block is in. For example, census block 3019 would be in 
block group 3.
Blocks are typically bounded by streets, roads or creeks. In cities, a 
census block may correspond to a city block, but in rural areas where 
there are fewer roads, blocks may be limited by other features. </div></span></div>"

#Grade 9 not in high schools_x000D_
##Indicates how special class is delivered_x000D_
_x000D_
For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. _x000D_
_x000D_
The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. _x000D_
_x000D_
The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, ���cluster��� teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers."

_x000D_
SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)_x000D_
#Grade 9 not in high schools_x000D_
##Indicates how special class is delivered_x000D_
_x000D_
For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. _x000D_
_x000D_
The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. _x000D_
_x000D_
The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, ���cluster��� teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers."
